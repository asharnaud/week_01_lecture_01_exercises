The three stages: 

1. Modify- This is when you are creating, editing, and deleting files in
the working tree. Basically where you write code. 
Relevant commands would be: git init, touch <file name>, mkdir <file name>,
nano <file name>, git branch, git rm, git log, and git status. 

2. Stage- This is where you tell Git that you intend to commit your files. 
Relevant commands would be: git add <file name>, git add -A, and git diff.

3. Commit- This is bascially the Git "save" button. You instruct Git to 
take the files from the staging are into a record in the repository 
history.
Relevant commands would be: git commit -m 'message'
