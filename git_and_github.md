Git- 
A tool you use directly on your computer through the command-line. It is
used to track and manage changes to your project. You can create repos, 
track any changes made, create files, create and merge branches, and you
can push and pull changes to remote repos. 

Github- 
A website that you use in your browser that lets you collaborate and 
it is focused around Git. You can publicy or privately collaborate on
projects. It lets you store a remote copy of git repos. You can review
your source code, change history, and reports. It lets you track issues,
bugs, and manage project tasks.

They are related to each other because Github is a place for you to store
a remote copy of your repo and it can be shared by all collaborators.
